### Bugfix: Spell syncing stops working until the GraphQL server is rebooted

**Cause:** EventEmitters were limited on the GraphQL server pub-sub system.

**Consequence:** After a certain number of users connected, spell syncing would stop and you saving spells in the Play App had no effect in Minecraft.

**Fix:** The EventEmitter limit was raised to Infinity!

**Result:** Spell syncing should now work reliably. When you save a spell in the Play App, it should be available immediately in Minecraft for you to cast it.
